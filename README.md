This project is inspired from the ThrottleBlaster project from Scrap Computing.

The PWM2STPCLK can mount directly to an ATX motherboard stand-off for direct chassis grounding and securing. This allows placement of the STPCLK pin wiring to be close to CPU and guarded from strain. A standard PWM fan controller can be used for simplicity, but plans for developing dedicated controllers and adapting the ThrottleBlaster is on-going.
